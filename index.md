## My Story

I started as a Roblox player, and when I discovered Roblox studio, I just couldn't stop. Fast forward a few years, and I have a [portfolio](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/officiall-studios-portfolio-ui-designer-scripter-gfx-3-d-modeling-vfx-video-editing/667889), a development [YouTube Chanel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2FvnmklfGvsbqlgBl7aYQg), and have worked on many different games!
